~Defying the odds, Ukraine held on to its capital and pushed Russia from the north. Now, as the Kremlin switches gears and begins a concerted effort to capture eastern Ukraine, Washington and its allies are pivoting as well, scrambling to supply Ukraine with bigger and more advanced weapons to defend itself in a grinding war.~The West is focused on sending longer-range weapons like howitzers, anti-aircraft systems, anti-ship missiles, armed drones, armored trucks, personnel carriers and even tanks — the type of arms that President Joe Biden said were tailored to stop “the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine.”~“The steady supply of weapons” has helped “ensure that Putin failed in his initial war aims to conquer and control Ukraine,” Biden said last week. “We cannot rest now.”~Then, after a video call with allies on Tuesday, Biden told reporters that the United States would send more artillery to Ukraine. He is expected to announce a new military aid package for Ukraine in the coming days, according to a person briefed on his plans. The aid amount will be on par with the $800 million package of weapons and artillery that was announced last week, the person said.~But the strategy comes with a notable risk: antagonizing Russia so much that it ignites a wider, international conflict.~Russia recently sent a formal warning to the United States, saying that Western deliveries of the “most sensitive” weapons systems to Ukraine could bring “unpredictable consequences.”~U.S. officials say the warning shows that the weapons being sent are making a big difference on the battlefield. So, for Washington at least, concerns about supplying arms that Russia might consider “escalatory” have ebbed — as has the initial worry that Ukraine will use longer-range weapons, like jet fighters, to attack Moscow itself and set off a bigger war.~

~Officials in Washington are now grappling with how much intelligence to give the Ukrainians about bases inside Russia, given that the Ukrainians have already made small helicopter raids on Russian fuel depots. The White House has also held back on supplying some weapons that could strike Russian forces across the border, like rocket artillery, ground attack planes and medium-range drones.~Some argue the Americans are being too cautious.~“Seven weeks ago, they were arguing over whether to give Stinger missiles — how silly does that seem now?” said retired Lt. Gen. Frederick B. Hodges, the former top U.S. Army commander in Europe. “We have been deterred out of an exaggerated fear of what possibly could happen.”~Anxiety about provoking a wider war persists among some NATO allies, most visibly in Germany, which worries that supplying Marder infantry-fighting vehicles, considered one of the world’s best armored vehicles, could be perceived by Russia as making Berlin and NATO parties to the war.~Robert Habeck, an influential minister in Germany’s new government, has said that supplying tanks would be an escalation and should be a matter of consensus within NATO and the European Union. “Heavy weapons are synonymous with tanks, and all NATO countries have so far ruled this out to not become targets themselves,” he said.~But these are sovereign — not alliance — decisions, and Washington and numerous allies are shipping such weapons anyway, concentrating on supplying Soviet-era weapons that the Ukrainians know how to use, along with Western arms the Ukrainians can absorb fairly easily.~Russia is striking Ukraine with abandon, complicating the flow of these newer weapons from Ukraine’s western borders with Poland, Romania and Slovakia to the battle in the east. That presents another risk: that Russian attacks could also stray across the Ukrainian border and hit NATO countries, “every inch” of which Biden has vowed to defend militarily.~How this logistical race goes could well shape the outcome of the war.~Russian forces, having suffered an embarrassing retreat from northern Ukraine and the suburbs of the capital, Kyiv, are repositioning for what the Kremlin and Ukrainian officials call a pivotal offensive to take eastern Ukraine.~Unlike many of the earlier battles, this one is expected to feature more tank battles on open ground, more long-range artillery and more weaponized drones.~The Western effort is both sprawling and expensive, with as many as 30 countries, not all of them members of NATO. The push now is to get countries with Soviet-era tanks, artillery and perhaps even fighter planes to provide them to Ukraine, with the promise that the United States will replenish them with more modern, Western-made arms in return. There is an especially acute need for Soviet-bloc standard 152-millimeter howitzer shells, since NATO uses a different, 155-millimeter shell.~The United States has also agreed to provide some 155-millimeter howitzers, along with 40,000 matching rounds, while trying to buy Soviet-standard ammunition from countries that use it, including nations outside Europe, like Afghanistan and even India, a long-standing buyer of Russian arms.~But that is not enough, Hodges argued. “We are still not thinking big,” he said. “We are still not thinking in terms of Ukraine winning.”~

~Unlike the early part of the war, when many countries seemed to compete to announce what they were providing Ukraine, the current race is being run largely in secret.~Much of the coordination, including how to get materiel into Ukraine, is being handled through the United States European Command, or EUCOM, based in Stuttgart, Germany, and through a blandly named International Donors Coordination Center set up with the British.~The command said that it established a “control center” to coordinate weapons and humanitarian assistance “from around the world” for Ukraine in early March. But it declined to discuss the details.~The Pentagon gave a hint, saying that the State Department had authorized transfers to Ukraine of American-provided defensive equipment from more than 14 countries this year.~But nations are trying not to advertise to Moscow exactly what is being provided. France says it has supplied 100 million euros of military equipment to Ukraine, without specifying what it has sent. Some countries have no desire to goad the Russian bear.~A clear example was the confusion over reports that Poland had supplied more than 100 Soviet-era T-72 and T-55 tanks to Ukraine. Poland refuses to confirm any such shipment.~Not all nations are being coy. The Czech government says it has supplied Ukraine with T-72 tanks and BMP-1 armored vehicles, while the Slovak government has made a big show of supplying a Soviet-era S-300 anti-aircraft missile system.~As for Germany, part of the problem is that its own supply of working armor is so low that it has little to spare. Beyond that, learning to operate a modern British, American or German tank can take up to six months, while Ukrainian fighters would have little difficulty operating familiar Soviet-era armor.~“We don’t really have time to get a lot of heavy American armor into Ukraine, and there isn’t time to train the Ukrainian military,” said Robert Gates, a former U.S. defense secretary. “But there is a lot of former Soviet military equipment still in the arsenals of the East European states.”~The United States, he said, “ought to be ransacking the arsenals” of former Warsaw Pact countries for armor and anti-aircraft systems, “with a promise from the U.S. to backfill over time with our equipment to our NATO allies.”~That is exactly what the United States is racing to do, Pentagon officials said, describing their own efforts to persuade the Slovaks to provide the S-300 missile system to Ukraine. On March 9, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin began speaking with their defense minister, Jaroslav Nad, and has agreed to send in Patriot batteries to replace it.~

~Similar conversations are taking place with other allies that have Soviet-era weapons and ammunition, the officials said. The Americans say they are also speaking several times a day with their Ukrainian counterparts about what Ukraine wants and needs, and what Western countries think they can best provide.~Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy repeatedly expresses gratitude for the aid but wants more, sooner. He admitted to being fed up with listing the same set of requirements over and over again to different national interlocutors, telling The Atlantic in Kyiv: “When some leaders ask me what weapons I need, I need a moment to calm myself, because I already told them the week before. It’s Groundhog Day. I feel like Bill Murray.”~There are also supply issues with Western weapons, like the older Stinger anti-aircraft missile or the Javelin anti-tank missile.~The Pentagon has urged manufacturers to ramp up production. So far, some 7,000 Javelins have been given to Ukraine, about a third of the total American inventory, which will probably take three or four years to replace, wrote Mark F. Cancian of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.~Last week, the Pentagon met with leaders of eight large military contractors, like Raytheon Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp., to discuss how to overcome any supply problems – both to replenish American weapons stocks that have been drawn down to help Ukraine and to keep Kyiv in the fight. The two companies together make the Javelin, and Raytheon makes the Stinger.~The United States alone has spent or allocated some $2.6 billion worth of such materiel since the war began Feb. 24, and the European Union has provided €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion). But there is no prospect of U.S. or NATO troops going to the aid of Ukraine, officials say. The West is providing the weapons and intelligence — and cheerleading from behind.~The known list of what has been provided already is long, and there is little doubt that supplies from NATO countries — and the training of Ukrainian forces after Russia seized Crimea in 2014, not to mention Ukraine’s tenacity and adaptability — have surprised the Russians, badly damaged their morale and extended the war.~In the months leading up to the war and afterward, the United States and its allies have sent Ukraine 25,000 anti-aircraft weapons and 60,000 anti-tank weapons, including 10,000 provided by Washington, Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress last week.~The United States has also provided more than 50 million rounds of ammunition, 7,000 small arms, 75,000 sets of body armor and helmets, and night-vision goggles, encrypted radios, armored trucks and personnel carriers, largely drawn from pre-positioned U.S. military stockpiles, much of it in Europe, according to the latest public list from the Pentagon.~Since the invasion, the Pentagon has cranked up its vast logistical and transportation network. Within four to six days after the White House approves a transfer of weapons from American military stockpiles, the Pentagon has been able to load the materiel onto cargo planes and fly it to about half a dozen staging bases in countries near Ukraine, chiefly Poland and Romania.~From there, U.S. officials say, the weapons and equipment are loaded onto hundreds of trucks and shipped into western Ukraine using a variety of overland routes. John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesperson, said it takes about 24 to 48 hours for the weapons to make their way from the staging areas into the hands of Ukrainian troops.~“Eight to 10 flights a day are coming into the region, not just from the United States, but from other nations as well,” Kirby said. “That stuff isn’t sitting around.”~Despite repeated threats to do so, the Russians have rarely tried to stop this flow of Western materiel into Ukraine. Pentagon officials say the Russians have been busy fighting in other parts of the country and fear Ukraine’s air defenses. “That flow still continues,” Kirby said.~Britain, which has been more public about its contributions in the post-Brexit period, has supplied about $588 million of materiel, including anti-tank and anti-ship missiles and long-range artillery.~Training the Ukrainians on new equipment in the middle of a war is a challenge, though. About a dozen Ukrainian soldiers were already training in the United States, and the Pentagon has taught them to use modern armed drones, like the 700 or so Switchblade drones that Washington is now providing.~Military officials call the weapon, which is carried in a backpack, the “kamikaze drone,” because it can be flown directly at a tank or a group of troops and is destroyed when it hits the target and explodes.~Bigger armed drones, like American-made Predators or Reapers, would be difficult for Ukrainians to fly and would be easily destroyed by Russian fighter planes. But Pentagon officials said the small, portable kamikaze drones could prove more cost-effective and elusive against Russian armored convoys.~After the White House announced the latest $800 million tranche of weapons for Ukraine last week, Kirby said that American soldiers would train Ukrainian forces in neighboring countries to use some of the newer, more sophisticated equipment Washington is providing, like radar systems, as well as the 155-millimeter howitzers and 11 Mi-17 helicopters.~“We’re aware of the clock, and we know time is not our friend,” he said.~This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2022 The New York Times Company","<p><span class=""dateline"">Brussels – </span>The race is on.</p><p>As columns of Russian troops began pouring into Ukraine nearly two months ago, the United States and its allies started supplying Kyiv with weapons and equipment for what many expected to be a short war: sniper rifles, helmets, medical kits, encrypted communications, lots of bullets and the portable, shoulder-held Stinger and Javelin missiles that quickly became icons of the conflict.</p><p><!-- /4973089/article_1 -->

About a dozen Ukrainian soldiers were already training in the United States, and the Pentagon has taught them to use modern armed drones, like the 700 or so Switchblade drones that Washington is now providing.</p><p>Military officials call the weapon, which is carried in a backpack, the “kamikaze drone,” because it can be flown directly at a tank or a group of troops and is destroyed when it hits the target and explodes.</p><p>Bigger armed drones, like American-made Predators or Reapers, would be difficult for Ukrainians to fly and would be easily destroyed by Russian fighter planes. But Pentagon officials said the small, portable kamikaze drones could prove more cost-effective and elusive against Russian armored convoys.</p><p>After the White House announced the latest $800 million tranche of weapons for Ukraine last week, Kirby said that American soldiers would train Ukrainian forces in neighboring countries to use some of the newer, more sophisticated equipment Washington is providing, like radar systems, as well as the 155-millimeter howitzers and 11 Mi-17 helicopters.</p><p>“We’re aware of the clock, and we know time is not our friend,” he said.</p><p class=""jt_bio"">This article originally appeared in <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/europe/us-ukraine-weaponry.html"" onclick=""__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/europe/us-ukraine-weaponry.html', 'The New York Times.');"">The New York Times.</a> <em>© 2022 The New York Times Company</em></p>",THE NEW YORK TIMES,"U.S., Russia, Ukraine, Russia-Ukraine war",27651a5e-0a1a-5e33-991e-8584179d1ff6,31/05/2022 08:06:12

Qassem Soleimani to his grave in one of the first known killings of a major military leader in a foreign country since World War II, when the American military shot down the plane carrying Japanese Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto in 1943.~
~Although North Korea’s initial reaction to the killing has been cautious, it was likely to have resonated in Pyongyang. The country’s state media was silent for three days before finally issuing a brief dispatch Monday on the attack that didn’t even mention Soleimani’s name.~But with Trump touting the killing as “a flawless precision strike” and vowing to “protect our diplomats, service members, all Americans, and our allies” and delivering a pledge to hit Iran “VERY FAST AND VERY HARD” if it takes retaliatory action, the attack was a message likely to resonate in Pyongyang, experts told The Japan Times.~“The North Koreans will be watching all of this unfolding very carefully,” said Andrew O’Neill, an expert on North Korea and a professor at Griffith University in Australia.~~O’Neill noted the Kim regime’s history of repeatedly pointing to the downfall of Iraq’s Saddam Hussein and Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi at the hands of the U.S. or U.S.-backed forces as justification for retaining its nuclear arsenal.~“Pyongyang went on the record after Iraq 2003 and Libya 2011 as having said that nuclear weapons are necessary to deter the U.S. from instituting regime change,” he said. “But I think they would generalize this to targeting state assets openly.”~Soleimani was the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s elite Quds Force, a position some military observers said was equivalent to the U.S. Central Command chief.~For Pyongyang, O’Neill said, this shift was stark.~“Cyberinterference is one thing, but the U.S. assassinating a senior North Korean military or political leader would be beyond the pale,” he said.~Indeed, Trump’s reported preference for the most extreme option on a menu of choices presented to him could rekindle the belief in the notoriously paranoid North that the U.S. is seeking regime change through decapitation strikes.~Trump and Kim exchanged barbs and threats of conflict as the North conducted a spate of weapons tests in 2017. But then in 2018, Kim initiated diplomatic talks with Washington and suspended nuclear and long-range missile tests. The opening came after months of concerns that Trump could consider preventive military action against the North.~Soleimani was killed in a barrage of missiles fired from a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone, ripped to pieces by the strike and identified only by a large ring with a red stone he wore on his hand, according to media reports.~For the Kim regime, this haunting image “might be seen as a sign that the U.S. is now willing and capable of drone-hunting those they see as their enemies,” Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin University in Seoul, wrote Sunday in an editorial for the NK News website.~On Monday, a South Korean newspaper reported that the same type of strike drone used in Soleimani’s killing had been temporarily deployed to South Korea.~The Munhwa Ilbo daily, citing an unidentified U.S. intelligence source, reported that Washington had “tentatively deployed” approximately four MQ-9 Reaper drones to Kunsan Air Base in the western city of Gunsan since late last year.~Asked for confirmation, U.S. Forces Korea declined comment, the South’s Yonhap news agency said.~The U.S. military has had 12 MQ-1C Gray Eagle combat drones on the Korean Peninsula since February 2018. The military has said the drones are used for surveillance purposes, but the MQ-1C is capable of carrying up to four missiles.~The use of drone strikes surged under Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and Trump has at times also employed the weapons. But while targeted killings under Obama rose, those were directed against terrorist operatives, with what observers have said was a careful and deliberate calibration in targeting.~“What’s different under Trump is that the president appears to put greater emphasis on shock tactics,” O’Neill said.~“Whereas the Obama playbook with drone strikes avoided targeting state-affiliated individuals, with Trump all bets are off after the Soleimani killing,” said O’Neill. “For this reason alone, my assessment is that Kim Jong Un — and certainly the senior people around him — have reason to be concerned about what materializes from the White House as they push ahead with North Korea’s nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) programs.”~

~Friday’s strike on Soleimani also came at a time of intense speculation about the future of the North’s denuclearization talks with the U.S. Just days earlier, Kim used a key address to his country’s ruling party to label his standoff with Washington as now one “between self-reliance and sanctions.”~That speech, in which Kim also said his country would continue to build up his arsenal, left many observers wondering if the talks were now effectively dead as he doubled down on trying to outlast crippling U.S. and international sanctions over his nuclear program.~But the Soleimani strike could be the final nail in the coffin for its diplomacy with the Trump administration, as it further reinforces the North’s belief that nuclear weapons are required to effectively deter attack.~“Although fundamentally different from the Gadhafi and Saddam situations, Soleimani, from Pyongyang’s perspective, is probably just the latest example of American acts of unilateral aggression in a long and running list,” said Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corp. “When viewed in this light, how can North Korea not have nuclear weapons to ensure regime survival? It must.”~In the near-term, though, the killing could also work to Trump’s advantage as he seeks a second term while grappling with looming impeachment proceedings.~“Kim has to at least consider the possibility that Trump, in a re-election year and facing impeachment, feels the need to demonstrate strong leadership, and thus may be inclined to take riskier action on the peninsula than previously thought,” Grossman said.~He said that the North, which ramped up its provocations as 2019 wound down — including the testing of an apparent rocket engine and an ominous threat to deliver a “Christmas present” to the United States — may now have to rethink this strategy.~“I believe Kim will now take a wait-and-see approach instead of rushing forward with an ICBM test,” Grossman said.~“This is not to say Kim won’t proceed at some point in the future — he almost certainly will. But I think Kim will also be a bit more hesitant now, especially if there is a U.S.-Iran war.”","<p>With the order to kill a top Iranian general last week, U.S. President Donald Trump may have rekindled Kim Jong Un’s worst fears while simultaneously cementing the North Korean leader’s belief that relinquishing his nuclear arsenal would be tantamount to suicide.</p><p>The U.S. on Friday unleashed a volley of missiles, sending Gen.

A similar concept in relation to the ocean is called satoumi.~At the session, Hidehiko Yuzaki, governor of Hiroshima Prefecture; Eikei Suzuki, governor of Mie Prefecture; and Gen Nakagawa, mayor of Nara, shared their thoughts on this topic. Hiroki Kuriyama, head of strategic business development and in charge of the 2020 Project at NTT Corp., moderated the discussion.~
~The following are translated excerpts from the discussion.~Kuriyama: Let me ask two questions to start with. Firstly, we will be talking about satoyama, but it is essentially the same as discussing the symbiosis of humans and nature. So could you introduce some of the policies related to the theme that you are focusing on as a municipality?~Secondly, can you please tell us about some policies particularly designed to deal with satoyama and satoumi?~
Hidehiko Yuzaki
~Yuzaki: Almost all policies related to people and nature are about satoyama and satoumi. Above all, our main focus is on human resource development. To be honest, we are facing the dilemma of how to promote the idea of satoyama capitalism as a local government. I feel that too much involvement of the government is likely to result in failure. Things usually don’t go well when the government takes the lead and tries new things, one after another. For example, offering subsidies, creating frameworks, introducing ordinances and so on. But doing nothing also raises questions about our role, putting us in a very difficult position.~What is the appropriate level of involvement? I think it is to offer help in human resource development, and build a network among different projects dealing with the field. For instance, facilitating the exchange of examples and introducing projects through various means, including the internet. We have already been trying these things.~” ‘Hito Yume’ Mirai Juku” (roughly, “Workshop for the future: people and dreams”) organized by Hiroshima Prefecture is one of the examples. It is a series of seminars in which participants actually plan and carry out projects to use the resources of satoyama and satoumi in business activities or regional revitalization. We also held “Satoyama Miraihaku” (approximately, “Expo on the future of satoyama”), an exposition to promote the future of satoyama last year. Many projects were launched in various parts in Hiroshima in connection with the expo serving as platforms for human resource development.~These kinds of activities help us find people with networking abilities, business talents and other qualities as leaders. So, what we are working on next is Hiroshima Satoyama Team 500, a project to find 500 such people, offering them opportunities to interact with each other and help them become regional leaders. They will be the core for the future activities in each region.~
Eikei Suzuki
~Suzuki: I would like to talk about ama, professional female divers who harvest marine products, because I think their way of life is a typical example of the symbiosis of humans and nature, and the activity to produce new economic values using natural resources.~“Nihon Shoki” (“Chronicles of Japan”), an old history book written more than 1,000 years ago, contains a description of ama as fishing divers. There are about 1,500 ama divers in 17 prefectures in Japan, with Mie Prefecture having the largest number of them. About half of the ama divers in Japan are in the Toba and Shima areas of Mie.~What is respectable about our ama divers is that they have their own rules to prevent themselves from overfishing. For example, there is a village that only lends out one wetsuit set per family, even if there are three ama divers in the house. If all divers in the area start fishing at the same time, they may end up depleting resources. The fishing area is also divided into six zones that are used in turn each year. Ama divers are practicing a sustainable use of resources by themselves.~Our support as a local government includes the promotion of fishery and tourism, and the preservation of ama culture as a cultural heritage. To increase ama divers’ income from catching abalone, we are planning to introduce a way to grow abalone larger so they are easier for the divers to catch. We have been helping them generate revenue by accepting tourists at amagoya, or ama huts. These places used to be only for the divers to rest and get warm, but now tourists can enjoy seafood caught by the divers. The preservation of the ama culture as a cultural heritage is exactly the kind of thing that can only be achieved with the involvement of the public administration. The traditional free-diving fishing method has been designated a cultural property by the prefecture since I took office as the governor of Mie. It has recently become a national cultural property as well.~
Gen Nakagawa
~Nakagawa: In our case in Nara, a city known for the Great Buddha and deer, the key industry is tourism in areas with World Heritage sites. About 15 million people visit the city of Nara annually.~However, the problem is that tourists visiting Nara tend to stay for only short periods of time. We are trying to use the resources of satoyama in a bid to increase the length of tourist stays. There are about seven old settlements that can be reached within about 20 minutes by car from the center of the city. We are in the process of promoting the use of farmhouses as minpaku (private lodging services) in collaboration with local farming families. We already have 36 families that are willing to accept visitors.~Looking at the global trend, tourism demand will undoubtedly increase. In participating in the global tourism market, it will be of great value for Japan to further appeal its colorful charms to the world. I believe that satoyama resources can be used effectively in diversifying the values of Japan from global perspectives.~Kuriyama: Now the keyword “minpaku” has been mentioned. Gov. Yuzaki, I hear that Hiroshima is quite aggressive in promoting it.~Yuzaki: To be precise, we want to promote it more aggressively. Various kinds of laws and regulations, such as the minpaku law, the Hotel Business Act, the Fire Service Act and the Building Standards Act got in the way in the process of promoting minpaku business, so we appealed to the national government to be more flexible. I think our claims have been accepted to some extent.~Mayor Nakagawa has just used a wonderful word. I think “colorful” means “diverse.” Most cities have the same shops and they look the same. I want people to see various places that are more real and flavored with history, but I don’t think those who are in the actual field are sharing the same awareness yet.~
Hiroki Kuriyama
~Kuriyama: What do you mean by “those who are in the actual field?”~Yuzaki: I mean those who have the vacant houses. They are having a hard time making those spaces useful. It costs money and effort to rent them out, so they tend to become reluctant. We need someone who leads and motivates them. This is exactly where human resource development is needed.~There are some successful examples in urban areas. In Onomichi, Hiroshima, a woman started the restoration of kominka old traditional houses. The project grew bigger and involved a lot of people. Dozens of such houses have been renovated as shops and accommodations, as well as residences for migrants.~Kuriyama: Gov. Suzuki, how are the regional leaders fostered in Mie?~Suzuki: The water of the Choshi River in the town of Kihoku is extremely pure. It’s so clean and clear the leader of a local nonprofit organization (NPO) is committed to introducing this beautiful river to more people.~I think it is important to support the people who stand up with the sense of urgency and pride in their hometown. The support should be provided in a way that they can continue their activities even after government assistance ends.~Kuriyama: May I have a comment on this from you, Mayor Nakagawa?~Nakagawa: Just as Gov. Suzuki mentioned, the best way is to put administrative resources where there is a sense of urgency and pride. In Nara, we devote resources to where there are possibilities, then observe for a certain period of time to see if they work, and withdraw if they don’t. We should take the risk of failures as the government following trial and error efforts.~Yuzaki: It is indeed important to help the regions that have passion and pride. The realization of satoyama capitalism is an economic activity to produce the cycle of economy by using the resources of satoyama, and to prevent outflow of economic values. So it does not work without the involvement of regions and people. All successful examples show a great deal of engagement from the regions.~Suzuki: Satoyama capitalism, satoyama and satoumi work well with themes such as diversity and active social participation of women.~There is an NPO named Mother’s Life Supporter in Suzuka, Mie. It is an organization that consists of mothers who have children from newborn to four years old. The mothers are divided into three groups: the work team, the child care team and the standby team. While the work team farms in the field near the mountain, the mothers of the child care team look after the children of their own and those of the women on the work team in a vacant house nearby. The standby team can substitute for whoever needs to leave due to the health conditions of their child.~The number of farming populations are decreasing in general. This is a model in which women of child-rearing age create economic values by participating in farming while their children are taken care of by their colleagues who are also mothers. Moreover, they are even making a vacant house useful again. I think it is a good idea to look at the resources of satoyama from the perspective of women, or in the context of diversity to produce new and sustainable economic values.~Nakagawa: The important point is that multiple themes are dealt with at the same time. In other words, it is about how to multitask. In Nara, the administrative services, such as water and sewerage in the mountainous regions, is unprofitable, so we are studying the possibility of using the national government subsidy in operating the water and sewerage on a concession basis. For example, one person would collect garbage in the morning, drive a school bus and operate a gas station in the afternoon, and provide plumbing services when necessary. I think there are many tasks that can be performed by one person both in communities and public sectors that would make management ideas easier.~Kuriyama: All three of the leaders have World Heritage sites in each city or prefecture. How are you going to use those assets in boosting the pride and motivation of the local people or as tourism and cultural resources?~Nakagawa: Nara’s Great Buddha is an overwhelming symbol of the city, but it is attracting so much attention that a variety of other tourism resources we have are hardly appreciated; this is our dilemma.~We, as a local government, often wonder what the purpose of tourism could be. People tend to start seeking mental contentment when they already have enough of everything in life. In that sense, the effect that satoyama can have on people’s minds seems to have the quality to satisfy the needs in tourism. Instead of coming to see a building or a Buddha statue just because it is the oldest or the biggest in Japan, we want visitors to understand the underlying concept of the place.~At the time when the Great Buddha was built (completed in 752), an epidemic had spread, wars had occurred and there was societal unrest. Why would anyone want to spend a vast amount of money to make a statue in a time like that? What were his feelings and how was the leadership of Emperor Shomu, who instructed the creation of the huge Buddha in just a decade? These kinds of themes are universal and inspiring to all people, regardless of nationality.~So, the way to make the best use of World Heritage sites is to share the understanding of why they are there, and to learn from the way of thinking, philosophy and life of the people who have preserved those assets until today. The concept of the Great Buddha had originally been the creation of the world where all living things, including animals and plants, prosper together. If you translate it into the modern world, it is the life of satoyama itself. Trips with such revelations will offer awareness and learning that international travelers can bring back to their own lives.~Suzuki: In terms of World Heritage sites, we have the Kumano Kodo pilgrimage routes. There is the Magose Pass, Matsumoto Pass and other well-known spots on the routes leading into mountains, and at the same time, Shichiri Mihama Beach and the Kumano River that form part of the routes are also designated as World Heritage sites. I think the whole series of the World Heritage sites of the Kumano Kodo is like a combination of all elements of satoyama and satoumi.~Our current focus is on building a closer and deeper network of people and helping the transition of generations. We want to increase the number of people who make a deep commitment to the region: those who love the Kumano Kodo, walk the routes again and again and put effort into their preservation. The people who can tell old tales of the Kumano Kodo are aging, so we also want to help them hand down the role to the younger generation.~Yuzaki: We have the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, or the Genbaku Dome, and Itsukushima Shrine, which is on the island of Miyajima. I don’t think the Genbaku Dome is part of satoyama (because it is located in the middle of the city), but Miyajima is an island blessed with abundant nature. However, the island is not categorized as part of satoyama or satoumi because it is considered a sacred island and no human intervention is allowed. It is totally different from satoyama, which is kept beautiful with the involvement of people.~Still, of course we want people coming to see these sites to enjoy their visits. I hope that they really get to know the real and diverse Japan, and regions with thousands of years of history.~Kuriyama: Lastly, may I have a concluding comment from Gov. Suzuki who is also the vice-chairman of the Japan Times Satoyama Consortium management committee?~Suzuki: Finding many partners will draw more attention to satoyama and satoumi, promoting deeper understanding that will then lead to sustainability. That is what I want the society to be like.~Kuriyama: Japan will be hosting the Olympic and Paralympic games in 2020. The Rugby World Cup and the G-20 summit will be held in 2019. These coming years are full of opportunities for our movements to expand and reach out to the world. Thank you very much.~Download the PDF of this Satoyama Consortium Special","<p><em>At the inaugural Satoyama Consortium symposium organized by The Japan Times on May 16 in Tokyo, municipal leaders discussed the possibilities of economic activities stemming from efforts involving “satoyama capitalism,” a concept recently promoted in Japan to take advantage of natural resources in satoyama, which are rural communal woodlots that are shared and maintained by local residents. A similar concept in relation to the ocean is called satoumi.</em></p><p><em>At the session, Hidehiko Yuzaki, governor of Hiroshima Prefecture; Eikei Suzuki, governor of Mie Prefecture; and Gen Nakagawa, mayor of Nara, shared their thoughts on this topic. Hiroki Kuriyama, head of strategic business development and in charge of the 2020 Project at NTT Corp., moderated the discussion.</em></p><p><!-- /4973089/article_1 -->
</p><p><em>The following are translated excerpts from the discussion.</em></p><p><strong>Kuriyama:</strong> Let me ask two questions to start with. Firstly, we will be talking about satoyama, but it is essentially the same as discussing the symbiosis of humans and nature. So could you introduce some of the policies related to the theme that you are focusing on as a municipality?</p><p>Secondly, can you please tell us about some policies particularly designed to deal with satoyama and satoumi?</p><p>

</p><p><strong>Yuzaki:</strong> Almost all policies related to people and nature are about satoyama and satoumi. Above all, our main focus is on human resource development. To be honest, we are facing the dilemma of how to promote the idea of satoyama capitalism as a local government. I feel that too much involvement of the government is likely to result in failure. Things usually don’t go well when the government takes the lead and tries new things, one after another. For example, offering subsidies, creating frameworks, introducing ordinances and so on. But doing nothing also raises questions about our role, putting us in a very difficult position.</p><p>What is the appropriate level of involvement? I think it is to offer help in human resource development, and build a network among different projects dealing with the field. For instance, facilitating the exchange of examples and introducing projects through various means, including the internet. We have already been trying these things.</p><p>” ‘Hito Yume’ Mirai Juku” (roughly, “Workshop for the future: people and dreams”) organized by Hiroshima Prefecture is one of the examples. It is a series of seminars in which participants actually plan and carry out projects to use the resources of satoyama and satoumi in business activities or regional revitalization. We also held “Satoyama Miraihaku” (approximately, “Expo on the future of satoyama”), an exposition to promote the future of satoyama last year. Many projects were launched in various parts in Hiroshima in connection with the expo serving as platforms for human resource development.</p><p>These kinds of activities help us find people with networking abilities, business talents and other qualities as leaders. So, what we are working on next is Hiroshima Satoyama Team 500, a project to find 500 such people, offering them opportunities to interact with each other and help them become regional leaders. They will be the core for the future activities in each region.</p><p>

</p><p><strong>Suzuki:</strong> I would like to talk about <em>ama</em>, professional female divers who harvest marine products, because I think their way of life is a typical example of the symbiosis of humans and nature, and the activity to produce new economic values using natural resources.</p><p>“<em>Nihon Shoki</em>” (“Chronicles of Japan”), an old history book written more than 1,000 years ago, contains a description of ama as fishing divers. There are about 1,500 ama divers in 17 prefectures in Japan, with Mie Prefecture having the largest number of them. About half of the ama divers in Japan are in the Toba and Shima areas of Mie.</p><p>What is respectable about our ama divers is that they have their own rules to prevent themselves from overfishing. For example, there is a village that only lends out one wetsuit set per family, even if there are three ama divers in the house. If all divers in the area start fishing at the same time, they may end up depleting resources. The fishing area is also divided into six zones that are used in turn each year. Ama divers are practicing a sustainable use of resources by themselves.</p><p>Our support as a local government includes the promotion of fishery and tourism, and the preservation of ama culture as a cultural heritage. To increase ama divers’ income from catching abalone, we are planning to introduce a way to grow abalone larger so they are easier for the divers to catch. We have been helping them generate revenue by accepting tourists at <em>amagoya</em>, or ama huts. These places used to be only for the divers to rest and get warm, but now tourists can enjoy seafood caught by the divers. The preservation of the ama culture as a cultural heritage is exactly the kind of thing that can only be achieved with the involvement of the public administration. The traditional free-diving fishing method has been designated a cultural property by the prefecture since I took office as the governor of Mie. It has recently become a national cultural property as well.</p><p>

</p><p><strong>Nakagawa:</strong> In our case in Nara, a city known for the Great Buddha and deer, the key industry is tourism in areas with World Heritage sites. About 15 million people visit the city of Nara annually.</p><p>However, the problem is that tourists visiting Nara tend to stay for only short periods of time. We are trying to use the resources of satoyama in a bid to increase the length of tourist stays. There are about seven old settlements that can be reached within about 20 minutes by car from the center of the city. We are in the process of promoting the use of farmhouses as <em>minpaku</em> (private lodging services) in collaboration with local farming families. We already have 36 families that are willing to accept visitors.</p><p>Looking at the global trend, tourism demand will undoubtedly increase. In participating in the global tourism market, it will be of great value for Japan to further appeal its colorful charms to the world. I believe that satoyama resources can be used effectively in diversifying the values of Japan from global perspectives.</p><p><strong>Kuriyama:</strong> Now the keyword “minpaku” has been mentioned. Gov. Yuzaki, I hear that Hiroshima is quite aggressive in promoting it.</p><p><strong>Yuzaki:</strong> To be precise, we want to promote it more aggressively. Various kinds of laws and regulations, such as the minpaku law, the Hotel Business Act, the Fire Service Act and the Building Standards Act got in the way in the process of promoting minpaku business, so we appealed to the national government to be more flexible. I think our claims have been accepted to some extent.</p><p>Mayor Nakagawa has just used a wonderful word. I think “colorful” means “diverse.” Most cities have the same shops and they look the same. I want people to see various places that are more real and flavored with history, but I don’t think those who are in the actual field are sharing the same awareness yet.</p><p>

</p><p><strong>Kuriyama:</strong> What do you mean by “those who are in the actual field?”</p><p><strong>Yuzaki:</strong> I mean those who have the vacant houses. They are having a hard time making those spaces useful. It costs money and effort to rent them out, so they tend to become reluctant. We need someone who leads and motivates them. This is exactly where human resource development is needed.</p><p>There are some successful examples in urban areas. In Onomichi, Hiroshima, a woman started the restoration of <em>kominka</em> old traditional houses. The project grew bigger and involved a lot of people. Dozens of such houses have been renovated as shops and accommodations, as well as residences for migrants.</p><p><strong>Kuriyama:</strong> Gov. Suzuki, how are the regional leaders fostered in Mie?</p><p><strong>Suzuki:</strong> The water of the Choshi River in the town of Kihoku is extremely pure. It’s so clean and clear the leader of a local nonprofit organization (NPO) is committed to introducing this beautiful river to more people.</p><p>I think it is important to support the people who stand up with the sense of urgency and pride in their hometown. The support should be provided in a way that they can continue their activities even after government assistance ends.</p><p><strong>Kuriyama:</strong> May I have a comment on this from you, Mayor Nakagawa?</p><p><strong>Nakagawa:</strong> Just as Gov. Suzuki mentioned, the best way is to put administrative resources where there is a sense of urgency and pride. In Nara, we devote resources to where there are possibilities, then observe for a certain period of time to see if they work, and withdraw if they don’t. We should take the risk of failures as the government following trial and error efforts.</p><p><strong>Yuzaki:</strong> It is indeed important to help the regions that have passion and pride. The realization of satoyama capitalism is an economic activity to produce the cycle of economy by using the resources of satoyama, and to prevent outflow of economic values. So it does not work without the involvement of regions and people. All successful examples show a great deal of engagement from the regions.</p><p><strong>Suzuki:</strong> Satoyama capitalism, satoyama and satoumi work well with themes such as diversity and active social participation of women.</p><p>There is an NPO named Mother’s Life Supporter in Suzuka, Mie. It is an organization that consists of mothers who have children from newborn to four years old. The mothers are divided into three groups: the work team, the child care team and the standby team. While the work team farms in the field near the mountain, the mothers of the child care team look after the children of their own and those of the women on the work team in a vacant house nearby. The standby team can substitute for whoever needs to leave due to the health conditions of their child.</p><p>The number of farming populations are decreasing in general. This is a model in which women of child-rearing age create economic values by participating in farming while their children are taken care of by their colleagues who are also mothers. Moreover, they are even making a vacant house useful again. I think it is a good idea to look at the resources of satoyama from the perspective of women, or in the context of diversity to produce new and sustainable economic values.</p><p><strong>Nakagawa:</strong> The important point is that multiple themes are dealt with at the same time. In other words, it is about how to multitask. In Nara, the administrative services, such as water and sewerage in the mountainous regions, is unprofitable, so we are studying the possibility of using the national government subsidy in operating the water and sewerage on a concession basis. For example, one person would collect garbage in the morning, drive a school bus and operate a gas station in the afternoon, and provide plumbing services when necessary. I think there are many tasks that can be performed by one person both in communities and public sectors that would make management ideas easier.</p><p><strong>Kuriyama:</strong> All three of the leaders have World Heritage sites in each city or prefecture. How are you going to use those assets in boosting the pride and motivation of the local people or as tourism and cultural resources?</p><p><strong>Nakagawa:</strong> Nara’s Great Buddha is an overwhelming symbol of the city, but it is attracting so much attention that a variety of other tourism resources we have are hardly appreciated; this is our dilemma.</p><p>We, as a local government, often wonder what the purpose of tourism could be. People tend to start seeking mental contentment when they already have enough of everything in life. In that sense, the effect that satoyama can have on people’s minds seems to have the quality to satisfy the needs in tourism. Instead of coming to see a building or a Buddha statue just because it is the oldest or the biggest in Japan, we want visitors to understand the underlying concept of the place.</p><p>At the time when the Great Buddha was built (completed in 752), an epidemic had spread, wars had occurred and there was societal unrest. Why would anyone want to spend a vast amount of money to make a statue in a time like that? What were his feelings and how was the leadership of Emperor Shomu, who instructed the creation of the huge Buddha in just a decade? These kinds of themes are universal and inspiring to all people, regardless of nationality.</p><p>So, the way to make the best use of World Heritage sites is to share the understanding of why they are there, and to learn from the way of thinking, philosophy and life of the people who have preserved those assets until today. The concept of the Great Buddha had originally been the creation of the world where all living things, including animals and plants, prosper together. If you translate it into the modern world, it is the life of satoyama itself. Trips with such revelations will offer awareness and learning that international travelers can bring back to their own lives.</p><p><strong>Suzuki:</strong> In terms of World Heritage sites, we have the Kumano Kodo pilgrimage routes. There is the Magose Pass, Matsumoto Pass and other well-known spots on the routes leading into mountains, and at the same time, Shichiri Mihama Beach and the Kumano River that form part of the routes are also designated as World Heritage sites. I think the whole series of the World Heritage sites of the Kumano Kodo is like a combination of all elements of satoyama and satoumi.</p><p>Our current focus is on building a closer and deeper network of people and helping the transition of generations. We want to increase the number of people who make a deep commitment to the region: those who love the Kumano Kodo, walk the routes again and again and put effort into their preservation. The people who can tell old tales of the Kumano Kodo are aging, so we also want to help them hand down the role to the younger generation.</p><p><strong>Yuzaki:</strong> We have the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, or the Genbaku Dome, and Itsukushima Shrine, which is on the island of Miyajima. I don’t think the Genbaku Dome is part of satoyama (because it is located in the middle of the city), but Miyajima is an island blessed with abundant nature. However, the island is not categorized as part of satoyama or satoumi because it is considered a sacred island and no human intervention is allowed.

That is what I want the society to be like.</p><p><strong>Kuriyama: </strong>Japan will be hosting the Olympic and Paralympic games in 2020.
